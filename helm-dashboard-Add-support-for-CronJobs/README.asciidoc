# Purpose

This is a very naive implementation of a K8s Dashboard that shows installed Helm releases with some details like their version and the connected ingress definition.
It is a Python application based on Flask and it processes the output of the `helm` and `kubectl` CLI tools.

## Usage

Build the container image from the `Dockerfile`, for example like this:

```shell
docker build --tag helm-dash:1.0 .
```

Create a dedicated `kubeconfig` file that only holds info about the cluster you want to show info for and make sure that its single `context` is the active one.

Now you can run the container image like this (note that youâ€™ll need to bind-mount that dedicated `kubeconfig` file; here we named it simply `config` and placed it in the current directory):

```shell
docker run --detach --rm \
  --publish 8080:5000 \
  --volume $(pwd)/config:/root/.kube/config \
  --name helm-dash \
  helm-dash:1.0
```

You should then be able to access it from http://localhost:8080/.
